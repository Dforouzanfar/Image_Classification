Binary Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains the code and documentation for a binary image classification project for the Machine Learning course at the University of Milan, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to classify images as either a Chihuahua or a cookie using three different CNN architectures: TinyVGG, AlexNet, and ResNet.

Introduction
This project aims to develop and compare three different CNN architectures for binary image classification. The models were trained and evaluated using three different learning rates to determine the optimal configuration. The best performance was achieved using a learning rate of 0.001 with AlexNet architecture.

Note: You can download the trained models and check their performance on the test set.
